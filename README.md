Magento CE 1.8.x  & 1.9.x Support
===================================

Magmi needs you to test it against Magento CE 1.8.x. & Magento CE 1.9.x

It should work for most of it, and maybe it's already working well.

But devil is in the details and i don't have much time doing an extensive test session.

So , if you are using Magento CE 1.8.x or CE 1.9.x , please provide bug reports for any found defects or any incompatibility you might have noticed.
